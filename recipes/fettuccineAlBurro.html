        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"Pasta Al Burro" is the Italian version of the American pasta dish "Fettuccine Alfredo". In the Italian version it is alot simpler and relies much more heavily on technique. I have made it a couple of times and have loved it each time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One Pound of Fettuccine Pasta either in a Box or Hand Made</li>
                <li>2 Cups of Grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
                <li>Half of Cup of Softened, Unsalted Butter</li>
                <li>Good Amount of Salt to Season the Water</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a pot, fill it with water, and then set it to boil</li>
                <li>Once your water is boiling salt it until it is "salty like the sea" (very salty)</li>
                <li>Place your pasta in the water and cook it specified on the box or until al dente</li>
                <li>Place your softened butter in a bowl where we will make the pasta</li>
                <li>Once the pasta is al dente save 2 cups of the pasta water for later</li>
                <li>Drain the rest of the water and now place your fettuccine in the bowl with the butter</li>
                <li>Mix the butter and the fettuccine until all the butter is melted, and once the butter is melted pour your 2 cups of parmigiano reggiano in the bowl</li>
                <li>Once again mix until there is a sauce coating on the noodles</li>
                <li>Add pasta water while mixing until you get the consistency of the sauce that you like. <strong>(Do Not Add too Much Pasta Water at Once)</strong></li>

                
            </ol>
